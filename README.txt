This is a python Script which is intended to be used with the XML output
of Pentabarf [1] or frab [2]. Its still under development and partially quiet hacky.
I got the source from Ulrich Dangel and started messing around with the code so blame 
me for the bad code quality and just don't use it if you don't like it :-).

There is also an android app that makes use of the output of this script.
You can find it on github [4].
