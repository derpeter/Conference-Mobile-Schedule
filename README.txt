This is a python Script which is intended to be used with the XML output
of Pentabarf [1] or frab [2]. Its still under development and partially quiet hacky.
I got the source from Ulrich Dangel and started messing around with the code so blame 
me for the bad code quality and just don't use it if you don't like it :-).

The version in this repository will be used for the FrOSCon [3] so you may need to remove some FrOSCon related strings.
